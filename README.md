### Arnavion's HexChat scripts
This is a mirror of Arnavion's script repository, which he has deleted. He gave
me permission to mirror these scripts but he requested that nobody contact him
about these scripts for any reason whatsoever. I do not take any credit for
these files, and I will neither modify them nor accept any changes to them.

Arnavion said himself that you are free to use these scripts and make changes as
long as you don't sue him or hold him liable for any damages, so feel free to
fork them and publish your changes locally.
